# Telecom Data Mining Application Presentation
## Part I: Text and Graph Mining Application
### Text Mining Application:
I've developed a robust text mining application that empowers employees to search for specific keywords within complaints. Using programming language techniques, I showcase the top five most relevant complaints to the query, facilitating efficient issue resolution. The application features a user-friendly graphical interface for seamless interaction and accessibility.

### Graph Mining Application:
My graph mining application provides insight into word connectivity within complaints. By visualizing word relationships through prefixes and suffixes, employees gain a deeper understanding of complaint semantics. Centrality measures highlight pivotal words in the graph, aiding in identifying critical issues. Additionally, I've developed a co-occurrence graph showcasing word associations across complaints, with edge weights representing co-occurrence frequencies. Both graphs are seamlessly integrated into the graphical user interface for comprehensive analysis.

## Part II: Real-World Data Mining Application
### Feature Extraction:
I've applied diverse techniques for feature extraction to reduce dataset dimensionality, enhancing computational efficiency and model performance.

### Clustering Techniques:
Utilizing various clustering algorithms, I've categorized the Telecom Network Quality Metrics Dataset into high and low service quality clusters. By segmenting the data, I enable targeted analysis and intervention strategies.

### Evaluation and Comparison:
I rigorously evaluate and compare results obtained from different clustering techniques, ensuring the selection of the most effective approach. Visual representations of evaluation metrics facilitate clear interpretation and decision-making.

## Conclusion
My data mining applications leverage advanced techniques to extract valuable insights from telecom complaints data. By enabling efficient text and graph mining capabilities and facilitating real-world application in network quality assessment, I empower the company to make informed decisions and enhance customer satisfaction
